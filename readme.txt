Herbs have played an important part in our development. It provided us with food, medicine and cosmetics. I strongly believe that, there is a remedy somewhere in nature for every illness. Today approximately 25% of all prescription drugs are derived from trees, shrubs or herbs. Digitalis is extracted from the leaves of foxglove, morphine and codeine are derived from the opium poppy, quinine from cinchona bark etc. The essential difference between herbalism and conventional medicine is that, while in conventional medicine the most active constituent is extracted from the plant and then synthesized in the laboratory to make the drug, in herbal medicine extracts from the whole plant are used.
